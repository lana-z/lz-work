## Lana Zumbrunn CLI Portfolio

A CLI-themed personal portfolio for Lana Zumbrunn. The landing page mirrors a macOS terminal session, showing staged commands (`just introduce`, `just projects`, `just contact`) with AI-focused project highlights, contact addresses, and a blinking prompt.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the site.

## Quality Checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

> `npm run build` requires network access (for font downloads) and permission to spawn helper processes; run locally outside of sandboxed environments.

## Deployment

The project is ready for Vercel. Push a feature branch, open a PR, then promote to `main` once verified.👍
